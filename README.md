# Car Components Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on accurately classifying car components, distinguishing between left, right, front, and back sides, using the YOLOv8 model. A manually labeled, diverse dataset was created and tested in various environments to ensure robust performance.

## Features
- **Model**: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for real-time object detection and classification.
- **Dataset**: Diverse car component images, labeled using CVAT.AI.
- **Testing**: Conducted with pre-recorded videos and real-time scenarios.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied to enhance model robustness and accuracy.

## Tools Used
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** for object detection
- **Python** for scripting
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation
